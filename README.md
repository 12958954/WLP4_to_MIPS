# WLP4_to_MIPS

This is the compiler converting WLP4 to MIPS. It is for project demonstration purpose only.

•	Scan high-level language WLP4 to tokens, parse them to make a parse tree, run semantic check, generate its corresponding assembly code, finally assembly it to MIPS machine code.
•	Demonstrated deep understanding how code is compiled, what is happening in the machine at low-level when the program is running. Knowing this is also helpful for debugging.
